# OOP Challenge
Create multiple classes that display usage of inheritance and composition.


# Summary
Simulate a food ordering system.
<br>
<br>
*NOTE 1: Not all methods are available for use from the hardcoded function call. Call these methods manually if needed.*
<br>
*NOTE 2: Due to poor logic, currently only main-backup.py is working. It consolidates all classes into a single file. I'll fix the logic when I stop being lazy.*


# Usage
* Run main-backup.py
* User is prompted for a name input
* User is asked if they are hungry. "Yes" response continues program, response of "no" exits.
  * 1 - Change Name
  * 2 - Change hunger status
  * 3 - View user info
  * 4 - Order food
  * 5 - Quit
* Option 4 runs the ordering functions. User is prompted for an option of "savory" or "sweet."
* Depending on which option is picked, the user is directed to functions to order specific food items.
